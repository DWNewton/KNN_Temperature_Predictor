    "# Short Term Temperature Predictor Using k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbor) Machine Learning Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "This script creates a short-term temperature predictor using the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script in this [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) notebook will:\n",
    "- Fetch historical weather data for a given location from a [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)\n",
    "- Preprocess the data\n",
    "- Save weather data to a .CSV file\n",
    "- Create and train a [k-NN ML model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-nearest-neighbours/) using your downloaded data\n",
    "- Predict temperature for a future date entered in the terminal by user\n",
    "\t- In practice, model accuracy will be between 2-6 degrees Fahrenheit ([RMSE](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_PREDICTIVE_ANALYTICS/41d1a6d4e7574e32b815f1cc87c00f42/5e5198fd4afe4ae5b48fefe0d3161810.html) = 2.00 - 5.79) based on the quantity and quality of weather data you provide for training the model.\n",
    "\t\t- Predicted accuracy is directly proportional to the amount of historical data you provide.\n",
    "\t\t- Providing only a weeks worth of data will net terrible performance if you ask the model to predict temperatures a more than a day or two out from the last data point in the model.\n",
    "\t\t- At least 6 months of valid historical weather data from your chosen weather API are recommended\n",
    "\n",
    "## Platform Prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.x or later (Developed with Python [3.13.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3131/))\n",
    "- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) notebook\n",
    "- [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/#description)\n",
    "- Required Python libraries: [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html), [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/), [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html), [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/), [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html), [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weather Dataset Prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you just want to try out the code, you can use my preexisting `weather_data.csv` file included in the repository.\n",
    "- If you want to get your own weather data, you will need to have your own personal API key to access either the [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx) or [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token) datasets. Do *NOT* share your API key with anyone else or post it publicly.\n",
    "- You must edit the code blocks to insert your own API key (Do not share this with others!) in order to retrieve your own set of weather data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "2. Navigate to the directory where you want to save the script.\n",
    "3. Download the script (this file) `ML_Temp_Predict.ipynb` either manually or by using the [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) command:\n",
    "\t- ```git clone https://github.com/DWNewton/KNN_Temperature_Predictor```\n",
    "\t- Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd KNN_Temperature_Predictor`\n",
    "\t- (Optional) \n",
    "\t\t\tIf you want to run the script in a virtual environment, create a new one and activate it:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\t`python -m venv .venv && source`\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\t`source venv/bin/activate` [macOS/Linux]\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\t`venv/Scripts/activate` [Windows]\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\tNOTE:\tTo uninstall the script, deactivate the virtual environment and remove it:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\t`deactivate && rm -rf venv` [macOS/Linux]\n",
    "\t\t\t\n",
    "\t\t`venv\\Scripts\\deactivate` [Windows]\n",
    "\n",
    "\t- Install the required libraries:\n",
    "\t\t```pip install pandas numpy sklearn requests```\n",
    "\t\tIf you encounter any issues while installing libraries, try updating your [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/#description) or [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) versions.\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "\t\t`csv`, and `datetime` are built-in Python libraries and should not need to be installed separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\t(Optional)\n",
    "\t\t\tTo run the script in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t- build the image: ```docker build -t knn_temperature_predictor.```\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\n",
    "\t- run the container: ```docker run -it knn_temperature_predictor```\n"
